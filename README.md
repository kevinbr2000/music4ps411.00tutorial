Hello! This is a tutorial inspired by Modded Warfare. (original vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdtxXGr4TMU) i love you modded warfare <33
In this tutorial i will show you people with the new 11.00 jailbreak who want to have custom music how to get custom music. 

Anyways, I got an error, that maybe you got too. In FTP clients such as FileZilla, i got an error saying "File unavailable". This depends that you dont have full permission to the system storage (i think). How you fix this is:

1. Get Ps4 Xplorer 2.0 from the Homebrew Store or from here: https://pkg-zone.com/details/LAPY20009
2. Install the program. (obviously) Launch the program and choose "Root Access" instead of "Sandboxed"
3. Do the button combination Triangle + L2 and enable "Get Full R/W". (Careful, this can cause damage to your system if youre not careful.)
4. Then you go into /mnt/sandbox/NPXS20001_000/app0/systembgm. There is a file named bgm_main.at9 that we want to change. Click on triangle (button on your Dualshock controller), then Rename. Like Modded Warfare said, just put a .bak at the end of it. (bgm_main.at9.bak)
5. Now you will have a backup of the original .at9 bgm file (the one you put .bak on). Then enable "Activate FTP" for ftp access. (Button combination: Triangle + L2 and then press "Activate FTP")
6. Send the .wav you converted to an .at9 to where the backup is. (/mnt/sandbox/NPXS20001_000/app0/systembgm) (Modded Warfare explains how to convert .wav files into .at9 in the original video above. 15:45 is the time in the video he says it.)
7. Once its finished, name the .at9 "bgm_main" (with the .at9 at the end, of course)
8. You are now finished with the file transferring process. Go into the Internet Browser on your ps4 home menu to refresh the home menu's bgm music. (If it doesn't work, change your theme in Settings.)
9. Tada! Your ps4 home menu should now be playing custom music! Cool, right? All credits to Modded Warfare though, he's the best.
